### The Call That Changed Everything

**Thursday, 6 PM:** Phone rings  
**Mom:** "Beta, we're coming to Bangalore tomorrow morning!"  
**Me:** *looks around flat* "Tomorrow... morning?"  
**Mom:** "Yes! Dad has a meeting, so we thought we'd surprise you!"

**Surprise?** More like **PANIC ATTACK**.

**Her response:** "Try KartSquare. They have everything."

### My Cleaning Hack Discovery

**Monthly deep cleaning** is cheaper than:
- Buying new things because you can't find old ones
- Eating out because kitchen is unusable  
- Losing security deposits
- Therapy for mess-induced stress

**Now I book Sunita's team monthly. Best ₹2,500 I spend every month.**

### The Real Talk

We're all pretending to be adults while secretly drowning in laundry and dishes.

**KartSquare doesn't judge. They just clean.**

Your parents will be proud. Your friends will be impressed. Your mental health will thank you.

**Stop living in chaos. One tap, and it's sorted.** 🧹✨
